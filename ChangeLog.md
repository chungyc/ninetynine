# Changelog for ninetynine

## Unreleased changes

See https://github.com/chungyc/ninetynine.

*   Use Parsec for parsing in non-solution code
    instead of using manually crafted parsers.

*   Improve code hygiene with HLint.

*   Rename `Problems.PostfixNotation` to `Problems.Monads` to be consistent
    with other supporting modules.

*   Remove `Duplicate` operator from `Problems.P79`, and also update
    the problem to require a more complete calculation history.
